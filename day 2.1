DIFFERENCE BETWEEN DOCUMENT AND WINDOW OBJECTS:
DOCUMENT OBJECTS:

                JavaScript Document object is an object that provides access to all HTML elements of a document. When an HTML document is loaded into a browser window, then it becomes a document object.

The document object stores the elements of an HTML document, such as HTML, HEAD, BODY, and other HTML tags as objects.

A document object is a child object of the Window object, which refers to the browser.You can access a document object either using window.document property or using object directly.


 syntax:  document.method_name; for getting the methods.

 some property of document object:cookie,domain,lastmodified,documentmode.


script>
		    
			document.write(document.domain +"<br>")
			document.write(document.lastModified +"<br>")
			document.write(document.documentMode +"<br>")
			document.write(document.title +"<br>")
			document.write(document.url +"<br>")

		</script>



 WINDOW OBJECTS:

                  avaScript Window is a global Interface (object type) which is used to control the browser window lifecycle and perform various operations on it.

A global variable window, which represents the current browser window in which the code is running, is available in our JavaScript code and can be directly accessed by using window literal.

It represents a window containing a webpage which in turn is represented by the document object. A window can be a new window, a new tab, a frame set or individual frame created with JavaScript.

Syntax:  window.property_name; for getting different property.

some window object methods:alert(),blur(),clearinterval(),close(),confirm(),focus(),open()
 

 <script>
        var win;
        // Open window
        function createWindow() {
          win = window.open("", "My Window", "width=500, height=200");
        }
        
        // Close window
        function closewin(){
            win.close();
        }
        </script>
